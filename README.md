# syntella
Syntella tells you about whats running on your system, open connections, services, network connectivity.

The report contains the following sensitive information:

Wifi names, Mac addresses, processes, programs, ports, servers, services, disk free, network connections, open files.

We don't capture any user files or filenames, unless they are open. So consider which websites you were visited just before running it. Netstat will still show closed connections for at least 2 minutes after closing, due to the the CLOSEWAIT and TIMEWAIT states of TCP/IP.

## installation
Drag the app into your Utilities or Applications folders

Double click the 04B Font, and click istall - to make it look cooler when it runs.
